============

BASH scripts to communicate with the everBeen REST API

**Concept**

These scripts revolve around calling the right `curl` invocation against set host, thus facilitating the use of the `EverBEEN` REST API. The scripts support multiple config files to enable switching between `EverBEEN` instances.


**Warning**

Same as the REST API (branched development), this set of scripts is still largely in beta mode.
